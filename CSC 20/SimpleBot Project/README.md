<p>Not really completed to the point of hypothetical consumer usage (Missing GUI component). However, can be run from an IDE with SimpleBotModel.</p>

<p>Credits Due:</p>
  <p><t>This project required me to use DrawingPanel.java, a program made by Stuart Reges & Marty Stepp.</p>
  <p><t>In addition, this project was supervised by my professor Ted Krovetz through each implementation of my programs.</p>
